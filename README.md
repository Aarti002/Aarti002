In a nutshell, 
🖥️ I'm a competitive programmer turned into a full-stack web developer. 
🌱 Trying to learn something new every day. Exploring new stuff every day. 
📃 Recently got my hands dirty with technical blog writing, and the good news is, I'm enjoying it.
Lately, I have been reading many system design articles which made me realise, there are so many things to learn in this field.
