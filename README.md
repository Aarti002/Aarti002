In a nutshell, <br/><br/>
🖥️ I'm a <a href="https://leetcode.com/pro001/">competitive programmer</a> turned into a full-stack web developer. <br/><br/>
🌱 Trying to learn something new every day. Exploring new stuff every day. <br/><br/>
📃 Recently got my hands dirty with <a href="https://medium.com/@aartikumarisingh3002">technical blog writing</a>, and the good news is, I'm enjoying it.<br/><br/>
Lately, I have been reading many system design articles which made me realise, there are so many things to learn in this field.
