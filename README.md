### Hello People 👋

Myself Aarti, I'm a Good Human, Hardworker, Lifetime Learner, Software Engineer, Open Source Contributor, Technical Blog writer, and Ukulele Player

In a nutshell, I'm a competitive programmer turned into a full-stack web developer. 
Trying to learn something new every day. Exploring new stuff every day. 
Recently got my hands dirty with technical blog writing, and the good news is, I'm enjoying it.
Lately, I have been reading many system design articles which made me realise, there are so many things to learn in this field.
